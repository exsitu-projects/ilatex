%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% START EDITING HERE
	We begin with the half-line IBVP
	\begin{imaths}
	    \begin{cases}
		q_t = \tfrac{i}{2} q_{xx},& x > 0,\, t > 0, \\
		q(x,0) = \phi(x),& x > 0,\\
		q(0,t) = u(t),& t > 0,
	    \end{cases}\tag{1}
	\end{imaths}
	using a centered discretization for $q_{xx}$,
	\begin{imaths}		
		\dot{q}_n(t) = \frac{i}{2}\left( \frac{q_{n+1}(t) - 2 q_n(t) + q_{n-1}(t)}{h^2}\right).\tag{2}
	\end{imaths}
	The local and dispersion relations are, respectively, 
	\begin{imaths}
		\partial_t \left(e^{-iknh} e^{Wt} q_n \right) &= \frac{i}{2 h^2}\Delta \left(e^{-ik(n-1)h} e^{Wt} q_{n} - e^{-iknh} e^{Wt} q_{n-1} \right),\tag{3}
	\end{imaths} 
	\begin{imaths}
		W(k) = \frac{i}{2}\left( \frac{2 - e^{ikh} - e^{-ikh}}{h^2}\right) = \frac{i}{h^2} \left[ 1 - \cos(kh) \right].\tag{4}
	\end{imaths}
	With the Dirichlet boundary condition, our transforms begin at $n = 1$ instead of at $n = 0$, resulting in the global relation
	\begin{imaths}
		e^{WT} \hat{q}(k,T) - \hat{q}(k,0) - \frac{i}{2}\left[ \frac{ e^{-ikh} f_{0} - f_1}{h} \right] &= 0, \quad \text{Im}(k) \leq 0.\tag{5}
	\end{imaths}
	To obtain our ``solution'' formula, we take the inverse transform,
	\begin{imaths}
		q_n(T) &= \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi/h}^{\pi/h} e^{iknh} e^{-WT}\hat{q}(k,0)\,dk + \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi/h}^{\pi/h}\frac{ i e^{iknh} e^{-WT}}{2}\left[ \frac{ e^{-ikh} f_{0} - f_1}{h} \right]\,dk.\tag{6}
