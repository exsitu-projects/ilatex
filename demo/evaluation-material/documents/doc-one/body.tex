	Consider the second-order discretized advection equation
	\begin{imaths}
		\dot{q}_n(t) = -c\left(\frac{q_{n-2}(t) - 4 q_{n-1}(t) + 3q_{n}(t)}{2h}\right).\tag{1}
	\end{imaths}
	Following the usual steps, the global relation is
	\begin{imaths}
		 e^{WT} \hat{q}(k,T) - \hat{q}(k,0) - c \left( \frac{ 4 e^{-ikh} f_{0} - e^{-2ikh} f_{0} - e^{-ikh} f_{0} }{2}\right)&= 0, \quad \text{Im}(k) \leq 0,\tag{2}
	\end{imaths}
	with dispersion relation
	\begin{imaths}
		W(k) = c \,\frac{e^{-2ikh} - 4 e^{-ikh} + 3}{2h},\tag{3}
	\end{imaths}
	and nontrivial symmetry
	\begin{imaths}
		\nu_1(k) = \frac{i}{h} \ln\left(4 - e^{-ikh}\right).\tag{4}
	\end{imaths}
	Solving for $\hat{q}(k,T)$ and taking the inverse transform, we obtain
	\begin{imaths}
		q_n(T) &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi/h}^{\pi/h} e^{iknh} e^{-WT} \hat{q}(k,0)\,dk\tag{5} \\
		&\quad\, + \frac{c}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi/h}^{\pi/h} e^{iknh} e^{-WT} \left( \frac{ 4 e^{-ikh} f_{0} - e^{-2ikh} f_{0} - e^{-ikh} f_{-1} }{2}\right)\,dk.
	\end{imaths}
		With the given Dirichlet boundary condition, we encounter the ghost point $f_{-1}(W,T)$, which is unknown. [\dots] Instead, we return to the continuous problem, where the PDE itself gives the Neumann boundary condition from the Dirichlet condition:
	\begin{imaths}
		q_x(0,t) = \frac{-1}{c}\,q_{t}(0,t) = \frac{-1}{c}\,\frac{\partial}{\partial t} q(0,t) = \frac{-u'(t)}{c} = \frac{-v(t)}{c}, \quad v(t) = u'(t).\tag{6}
